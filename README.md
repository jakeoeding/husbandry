# Husbandry
*A console-based survival game*
## Rules
* Your objective is to provide your family with food and milk.
* Your family consists of a wife and two kids.
* Each day in the game, you can choose to either plant crops or milk your cow.
* There are two choices of crops to choose from: corn and wheat.
* Corn takes longer to grow, but is easier to harvest.
* Wheat is quicker but also harder to grow. It provides more food upon successful harvest.
* In order to survive each day, you will need to have at least 1 piece of corn or wheat for each family member.
* Additionally, you will need to have one milk per day for your family to split.
* The world is unpredictable. You will be faced with a random event each day which may be good, bad, or neutral.
* As the days go on, the difficulty increases and you are more likely to be faced with bad random events.
