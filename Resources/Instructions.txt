You are a poor farmer.
Your objective is to provide for your family.
You currently have a wife and two kids.
Each day, you can plant crops or milk your cow.
You have two choices of crops: corn and wheat.
Corn takes longer to grow, but is easier to harvest.
Wheat is quicker and harder to grow than corn. It also provides more food than corn upon successful harvest.
In order to surive each day, you will need to have at least 1 corn or wheat for each member of your family.
Additionally, you will need one milk for you and your family to split each day.
Last warning: The world is unpredictable. Do your best to plan ahead!
